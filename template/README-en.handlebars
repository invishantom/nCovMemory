## Introduction

Hello guys, we are a group of Chinese from all over the world gathering together to translate reports on Chinese media about the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia.  By translating reports at first-hand from inside the affected areas in China, we try to afford a panorama of the epidemic situation to the occidental, so as to tackle the issue of xenophobia even to racism against Chinese people worldwide due to information asymmetry.

### Legends

* Articles that have been added within the last 24h are marked with 🔥. 
* Links that have gone deleted or censored are indicated by ❌, appended with links to article backups elsewhere (if available). 
* We would try our best to find correct English name for medias. We strongly suggest you use both translated name and the original Chinese name for accuracy.

## Overview

This is an archive of in-depth reports and personal narratives of the first-hand witnesses on the COVID-19 outbreak, published by media organizations and WeChat official accounts in Mainland China. This archive is being continuously updated.

It is our hope that this archive can help you understand the outbreak and how it has affected everyone involved, and also help researchers in related fields with preliminary data collection.

### Usage Guide

* Classification and inclusion criteria:

  * News reports: Articles from reputable and reliable news agencies and WeChat official accounts that are characterized by their careful research, nuanced presentation, or novel perspectives, especially the descriptive reports coming from the frontline and the grassroots (including all areas, populations, and industries, not limited only to the most publicized ones). A few of these are photography-centered. The authors should not be the narrators or the interviewees themselves. 

  * Personal narratives from first-hand witnesses: Personal documentations of how individual lives have been affected by the outbreak, from a first-person point of view. These contents are mostly from WeChat official accounts. (Stories posted to Douban can be found in the Related Sites below).

* We do not accept commentaries, analyses, or works of science communication.
